The economy continues to boom, thanks in part to the sweeping tax cuts of 1961; his Family Assistance Plan (FAP), signed nearly five years ago, is reshaping welfare as the nation once knew it. <br><br>Even with these domestic successes, matters outside the Beltway are far from settled. Five years after his gamble in Cuba and the overthrow of Fidel Castro, American boots still occupy the island, now wracked by unrest, protest, and mounting violence. In Vietnam, the “peace-keeping” mission keeps expanding as Congress, vote by vote, authorizes more troops. The prospect of a draft and a broader war looms larger by the day. <br><br>  Civil rights remains foremost in the minds of many Americans. Each year of Nixon’s presidency has ended in disappointment on that front; whenever votes inch forward, the total is never quite enough, and the Southern filibuster endures. Yet demonstrations now light up cold Southern streets almost nightly, the promises Nixon made in 1960 and 1964 echo back at him, and quiet conversations with Majority Leader Johnson hint that a breakthrough may finally be at hand. <br><br> The calendar, however, is unrelenting. Nixon’s final midterms draw near. In 1962, buoyed by a triumphant first hundred days and the early victory in Cuba, he rode a wave of optimism. That momentum now seems to be slipping away. Staff note that he stays up later, nursing a glass of bourbon longer than he once did. Cuba, Vietnam, civil rights, every unresolved burden settles on him when the West Wing empties and the phone lines fall silent. For a man once defined by perpetual motion, he now lingers. Reflects. Drinks. </p>",

In the past few years the vice president has been absorbed by foreign affairs, focusing most of all on the Big Minh regime in South Vietnam; he has already visited Saigon twice since the Nixon–Lodge ticket won re-election. These days he delivers speeches in front of sandbags rather than rotundas, and he shakes the hands of generals instead of governors. <br><br> Even during the first term Lodge could still catch his breath. Now he moves like a man living out of a duffel bag, speaking with the President by telephone more often than he would like.  <br><br> Yet the grind offers a prize. The former senator and former United Nations ambassador believes that once this circus ends he will stand as a tested, active vice president ready for a run of his own in 1968. Respected, seasoned, perhaps even the early favorite, he tells himself he just needs another cup of coffee. <br><br> First, though, there is the matter of the coming midterms. The sixth year of a presidency is rarely kind to the governing party’s numbers in Congress. With rising domestic unrest, growing unease over overseas deployments, and a creeping weariness with Republican rule, the narrow majorities Lodge would need for a first term of his own already seem to be slipping away. </p>",
